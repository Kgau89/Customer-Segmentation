# Customer Segmentation

**Overview:** 
This project utilises a rich dataset of over 1.8 million credit card transaction records to derive meaningful insights into customer behavior to enhance the understanding of customer segmentation. The ultimate goal is to enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and personalised offers to different customer segments, thereby improving customer engagement and maximizing revenue potential.

**Problem:**
Businesses need to better understand their customers to offer targeted services and promotions. However, the volume and complexity of transaction data make it challenging to efficiently extract actionable insights. The key problem this project addresses is how to effectively segment customers based on their credit card transaction behavior. 

**Solution:**
This project focuses on developing and implementing data analysis techniques to accurately segment customers and provide actionable recommendations for personalized marketing initiatives.

**Actions Performed:** 
Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, K-means Clustering and the Elbow method

**Results Summary:**
Cluster 0 (Purple): 4% in size, characterised by younger customers making smaller to moderate transactions, present across various city sizes but more concentrated in larger areas.
Cluster 1 (Red): 33% in size, represents middle-aged to older customers with low to moderate transactions, predominantly in medium to larger city populations.
Cluster 2 (Yellow): 63% in size, represents older customers with higher transactions and potentially lower spending needs.
